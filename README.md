# Visual Overhaul Patches (VOP)

Some of the patches I created for KOReader (works with both Coverbrowser and Project: Title plugin).

**NOTE: If you want to use any of these patches, first you MUST install the `2--disable-all-CB-widgets.lua` for Coverbrowser or `2--disable-all-PT-widgets.lua` for Project: Title. Otherwise the patches may not work properly.**

All the .lua files should go into `koreader/patches` and all the .svg files should go into `koreader/icons` folder of your e-reader.

All these patches are tested on KOReader 2025.10 "Ghost" and Project: Title v3.5 and works perfectly.

## 🞂 2--disable-all-CB-widgets.lua

This patch disables all the progress and status related widgets from **COVERBROWSER** such as, progress bar, status icons and collection icons from the book's cover, giving us a clean cover. This helps to draw the new widgets with ease.

You **MUST** install this first if you are using default KOReader interface that is **Coverbrowser** plugin and if you want to use any of the other patches in this repo.


## 🞂 2--disable-all-PT-widgets.lua

This patch disables all the progress and status related widgets from **PROJECT: TITLE** such as, progress bar, percent read, pages read and status icon from the book's cover, giving us a clean cover. This helps to draw the new widgets with ease.

You **MUST** install this first if you are using **Project: Title** plugin and if you want to use any of the other patches in this repo.


## 🞂 2--rounded-corners.lua

<img width="720" height="325" alt="Rounded corners to book covers" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed550b96-a4dc-4354-9e91-c38195d9596f" />

This patch adds rounded corners to book covers in mosaic menu view. 

Download the icons `rounded.corner.bl.svg`, `rounded.corner.tl.svg`, `rounded.corner.br.svg` and `rounded.corner.tr.svg` from my icons folder and place the icons in `koreader/icons` in your e-reader.


## 🞂 2-new-status-icons.lua

<img width="561" height="174" alt="Custom status icons in black and white" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4da6bebf-3519-4e68-890d-7590c8bce622" />

<img width="561" height="174" alt="Custom status icons in colour" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f9bbe07-61ee-4e80-a4b9-5115948997ca" />


A set of new custom icons for displaying the status of a book (reading, abandonded, finished) in black and white and in colour.

Just copy the respective `dogear.abandoned.svg`, `dogear.reading.svg` and `dogear.complete.svg` to your e-reader's `koreader/icons` folder.


## 🞂 2-pages-badge.lua

This patch adds the page number of a book to its cover on the bottom left as a small rounded badge. 

**IMPORTANT:** This patch parses the page number from Project Title's database or from the title of the file, in the following formats `P(123)` or `p(123)`. So make sure your book's title contains the page number in this format if you are using coverbrowser. (I'll work on improving page detection mechanism for coverbrowser soon)

**NOTE:** Page number's font size, color, backgroud color, border thickness, rounded corner radius can be adjusted to your liking in the .lua file.


## 🞂 2-percent-badge.lua

This patch adds the progress percentage of a book as a badge in the top right corner of the cover.

Copy the `2-percent-badge.lua` to `koreader/patches` and copy the `percent.badge.svg` to `koreader/icons` folder of your e-reader. You can choose coloured or bw icons based on your device/liking.

**NOTE:** Percent badge's size, location, text size can be adjusted to your liking in the .lua file.
